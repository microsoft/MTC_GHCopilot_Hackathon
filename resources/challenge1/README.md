# Github Copilot Hackathon

The goal of a GitHub Copilot Hackathon is to learn how to use it, using a real-world scenario that consists of building a Python or Java application. Your solution should demonstrate how GitHub Copilot can help you with API usage, data parsing, and error handling.

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code assistant that helps developers write better code faster. It uses machine learning models trained on billions of lines of code to suggest whole lines or entire functions based on the context of what youâ€™re working on. By using Copilot, you can learn how to write better code and improve your productivity.

Remember:

- As you type GitHub Copilot will make suggestions, you can accept them by pressing Tab.
- If nothing shows up after Copilot writes some lines, press enter and wait a couple of seconds.
- On Windows, MacOS or Linux, press Ctrl + Enter, then click Open GitHub Copilot.

# Problem Statement

Python - Weather Forecasting Tool

Create a command-line tool that accepts a city's name and returns the current weather forecast. Your solution should demonstrate how GitHub Copilot can help you with API usage, data parsing, and error handling.

- Leverage OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data by city and parse it using Python.
- Retrieve the API key from your Coach and the API service endpoint from https://openweathermap.org/api

# Prerequisites

- Import required libraries
Start by importing the necessary Python libraries such as requests, os and json to make API requests and parse JSON data.
